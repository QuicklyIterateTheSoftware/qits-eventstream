/**
 * The scope's hygiene, which is the whole of what it has to get right.
 *
 * <p>Every assertion here is about a thread being left as it was found. Both threads this runs on
 * in production are long-lived and reused — a websockets-next worker and, one repo layer up, a
 * single {@code ci-run-worker} that outlives every run in the process — so a value that leaked out
 * of a scope would not be a stale parent on one event, it would be a stale parent on every event
 * for as long as the process ran, with nothing anywhere to say so.
 *
 * <p>Plain JUnit. The class has no CDI in it and needs none: it is a static thread-local and the
 * two methods around it.
