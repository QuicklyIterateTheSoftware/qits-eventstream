/**
 * Hands the running {@link EmbeddedPg} to every {@code @QuarkusTest} here, as the three keys a
 * deployment would supply: {@code jdbc.url}, {@code username}, {@code password}.
 *
 * <p>It is a config source rather than three lines in {@code
 * src/test/resources/application.properties} because the port is chosen at run time — the instance
 * takes a free one, so nothing can be written down ahead of the JVM that starts it.
 *
 * <p>The ordinal sits above application.properties (250) so this wins over both the shipped defaults
 * in this jar's {@code META-INF/microprofile-config.properties} (100) and anything the test
 * properties file might carry, and it is registered through {@code META-INF/services}, which is how
 * a config source joins a Quarkus application without being a bean.
 *
 * <p>What it supplies are the same three keys the shipped file resolves from {@code
 * QITS_RESOURCE_EVENTSTREAM_*}. The suite sets the values rather than the variables on purpose: the
 * shipped expressions have no defaults, and a test run that also had to export environment variables
 * would be a test run that could not say what happens when they are missing.
