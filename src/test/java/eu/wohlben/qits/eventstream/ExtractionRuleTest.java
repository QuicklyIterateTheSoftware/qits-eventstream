/**
 * THE EXTRACTION RULE, which outlived the extraction.
 *
 * <p><b>It was written to make lifting this library out of qits-ci a {@code git mv} plus a pom</b>,
 * by failing the build on any {@code eu.wohlben.qits.ci.*} import that had crept in because the
 * class happened to be right there. That job is done, and on the face of it the rule is now
 * structural: this repo cannot import what is not on its classpath, and adding a consumer to the
 * pom would be visible in the diff that did it.
 *
 * <p><b>It is kept, and widened, because the direction it protects is permanent.</b> A library that
 * has left is not a library that cannot be dragged back: the failure mode is a "temporary"
 * dependency added to this pom to reach one class of a consumer's, at which point every consumer of
 * this jar inherits it and the arrow that made the split worth doing points both ways. The rule is
 * therefore no longer about qits-ci — it is about <em>any</em> consumer — so the grep now rejects
 * every {@code eu.wohlben.qits.*} package except this library's own. qits-ci was only the first
 * consumer; naming it here would have been a rule about a repository rather than about a direction.
 *
 * <p>The class name stays as it was, because "the extraction rule" is what this is called in
 * qits-ci's own notes and in this repo's README, and a rule that changes its name loses the
 * argument that went with it.
 *
 * <p>Grepping the sources rather than the classpath is deliberate and is the part that still earns
 * its keep: a compile-time dependency is caught by the pom, and this catches the thing the pom
 * cannot — a source file reaching for a type that some transitive jar happened to bring along.
