 * A clock the suite moves by hand. Being a bean of type {@link Clock} is the whole mechanism — it
 * outranks {@code EventstreamClock}'s {@code @DefaultBean} producer with no alternative and no
 * priority — so the sweeper and the outbox read this everywhere in the test application.
 *
 * <p>It exists so the retry schedule can be walked in milliseconds instead of the eighty-odd
 * seconds it really spans. A test that slept through the real backoff would be a test nobody runs.
