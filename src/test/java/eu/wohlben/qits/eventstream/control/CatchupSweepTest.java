 * stream cannot deliver.
 *
 * <p>Against {@link StubEventsServer}'s list route, which pages the way the real one does — that is
 * the only honest way to test a paging loop, because the properties under test are exactly the ones
 * a canned answer cannot exhibit: a cursor that neither drops nor repeats a row across a boundary,
 * and a {@code nextCursor} that is null on the last page even when the page came back full.
 *
 * <p>The sweep is driven by hand. The scheduler is off in this suite and so is the startup run, for
 * the reason the outbox's is: a tick landing behind a test is non-determinism, and the arrangement
 * here is a log being seeded row by row.
