/**
 * Dark means dark. {@code qits.eventstream.enabled=false} is the posture every deployable takes
 * in {@code %dev} and {@code %test}, and the reason it is worth a test of its own is that "disabled"
 * has four separate ways to leak: a publish that still dials, an outbox sweeper that still drains, a
 * subscriber that still holds a socket open against a service nobody started, and a catch-up sweep
 * that still reads a log and writes a watermark.
 *
 * <p>The stub is here <b>so that a dial would be visible</b>. Asserting "no exception was thrown"
 * would pass against every one of those leaks; asserting that a real listening server saw nothing
 * at all does not.
