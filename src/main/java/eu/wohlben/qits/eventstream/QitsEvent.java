/**
 * Something that happened, worth telling the rest of the platform about. Implementations are plain
 * data — a record or a small final class — and their <b>fields are the payload</b>: {@link
 * QitsEventBus} canonicalizes them to JSON and the four methods declared here are excluded from it,
 * so an implementation never has to think about which of its members are wire and which are
 * envelope.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not a CDI event type and deliberately not a reactive-messaging message. Firing a
 * bare {@code jakarta.enterprise.event.Event} would make a remote arrival indistinguishable from a
 * local one at every {@code @Observes} site — a service that both fires a type locally and
 * round-trips it through the bus would deliver it twice — and a reactive-messaging connector is
 * real machinery for a first cut. The reasoning is in the superproject's eventsourcing-plan.md —
 * that file keeps the name this library shed, because it is a document that was written; the
 * consequence is that this interface is the whole contract and the transport is free to change
 * underneath it.
