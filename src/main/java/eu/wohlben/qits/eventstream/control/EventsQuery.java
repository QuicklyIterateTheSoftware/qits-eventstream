/**
 * Reading the log back — the other half of {@link EventsPublisher}, and the machinery behind
 * catch-up.
 *
 * <p>Two questions, both answered by {@code GET {qits.events.url}/events/api/events}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #after} — the next page of events <b>strictly after</b> a cursor, oldest first. This
 *       is what a watermark is paged forward with, and it is why the log grew an {@code order=asc}
 *       mode: descending walks away from a watermark, so a consumer would have to read all of
 *       history back to its own position and reverse it.
 *   <li>{@link #newest} — the single newest matching event, which is where a consumer that has never
 *       run starts. Descending with {@code limit=1}, the reading the route has always answered.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The cursor is the composite {@code <occurredAt>,<id>} the log hands out, and it is composite
 * because sibling events published by one pipeline run share that run's finish instant: a scalar
 * cursor either repeats a sibling or drops one, and those are exactly the rows a release train is
 * read for.
 *
 * <p><b>A failure is {@link Unavailable} and never an empty page.</b> The distinction is
 * load-bearing: an empty page means the consumer has reached the head of the log and its watermark
 * may advance, while an unreachable log means nothing at all was learned and the watermark must stay
 * where it is. Returning an empty list for both would let one outage settle every event that
 * occurred during it.
 *
 * <p>The client is pinned to HTTP/1.1 and is an instance field for the two reasons {@link
 * EventsPublisher} spells out — a body-carrying {@code h2c} upgrade delivers twice, and a static
 * {@code HttpClient} is built into a native image's heap.
