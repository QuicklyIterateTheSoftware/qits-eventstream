/**
 * The one place JSON is produced or read on the way to and from qits-events.
 *
 * <p><b>Canonical means the string is a function of the value and of nothing else.</b> Object keys
 * are sorted, there is no insignificant whitespace, and an absent (null) field is omitted rather
 * than written as an explicit null. That matters because canonicalization happens <em>here</em>,
 * in the publisher, while the server stores the string verbatim and compares it byte-for-byte to
 * decide whether a repeated {@code PUT} is an idempotent replay (200) or a reused UUID (400). Two
 * serializations of the same event that differ by a space or by field order are, to qits-events, a
 * contradiction — so every knob that could make them differ is set explicitly below rather than
 * inherited.
 *
 * <p>Which is also why this mapper is built by hand instead of injecting the CDI {@code
 * ObjectMapper}: that one belongs to the consuming application and any {@code
 * ObjectMapperCustomizer} anywhere on its classpath can change it. The wire contract cannot be
 * downstream of that.
 *
 * <p>Three settings carry the whole guarantee and none of them is a default:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code SORT_PROPERTIES_ALPHABETICALLY} — key order stops depending on the order fields
 *       happen to be declared in, so reordering a record's components is not a wire change.
 *   <li>{@code SORT_CREATOR_PROPERTIES_FIRST} <b>off</b> — on (its default) creator properties are
 *       emitted in declaration order ahead of the rest, which is exactly the dependency the line
 *       above removes, and every event class is creator-based. Jackson 2.21 happens to let
 *       alphabetical win anyway; the explicit disable is what keeps that from being a version fact.
 *   <li>{@code NON_NULL} inclusion — "no nulls for absent fields". The envelope is the one exception
 *       and says so on itself with {@code @JsonInclude(ALWAYS)}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS} is disabled so an {@link Instant} is
 * {@code 2026-07-31T12:46:03Z} rather than a float — the contract's spelling, and the one a human
 * reading the event log can compare.
 *
 * <p>The mix-in is what keeps {@link QitsEvent}'s own four methods out of a payload. An event class
 * is free to hold its {@code eventId} as an ordinary record component — the accessor matches the
 * interface method, so the mix-in hides it — and the library, not each event author, is what
 * guarantees identity travels in the envelope and never in the body.
