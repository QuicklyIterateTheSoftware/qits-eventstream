/**
 * The single HTTP call this module makes: {@code PUT {qits.events.url}/events/api/events/{id}} with
 * the envelope. Used twice — once inline by {@link eu.wohlben.qits.eventstream.QitsEventBus} and
 * again by {@link OutboxSweeper} — with identical semantics, which is what makes "a retry is the
 * same request" true rather than merely intended.
 *
 * <p><b>The four answers are four different futures</b>, and collapsing any pair loses something:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>200 / 201</b> — delivered. 201 wrote the row, 200 found it already there with the same
 *       content. A replay is a success, not a conflict; that is the whole point of the client
 *       choosing the UUID.
 *   <li><b>400</b> — rejected, permanently. qits-events answers it when the id exists carrying
 *       <em>different</em> content, i.e. a UUID was reused. Retrying cannot change that, and a row
 *       that kept retrying it would look like an outage.
 *   <li><b>any other status</b> — refused. A 5xx, a proxy's 502, a 404 from a path that is not
 *       there: a response <em>arrived</em> and said no. Something is answering, it understood the
 *       request enough to reject it, and the outbox spends its bounded budget on this class.
 *   <li><b>no response at all</b> — unreachable. A connection refused, a name that does not
 *       resolve, a deadline that passed with nothing on the socket. Nothing was learned about the
 *       event, only about the network, so the outbox <b>never gives up</b> on this class.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The last two used to be one, and merging them cost real events.</b> Measured on the
 * 2026-08-10 bootstraps: a seed qits-ci was pointed at an alias that did not resolve, every publish
 * raised {@code ConnectException}, and five attempts later every row was {@code FAILED} — a hole in
 * the log that no consumer bookkeeping can recover. A refusal is evidence about the event; an
 * unreachable bus is evidence about nothing at all, and a budget is only meaningful against
 * evidence.
 *
 * <p>The call is <b>synchronous and bounded</b>. Synchronous because the caller has to know which
 * of the three happened before it decides whether to persist anything, and bounded because the
 * publish hook sits on qits-ci's single-threaded run worker: an unbounded wait here would park
 * every pipeline on the instance behind one unreachable service. The request deadline is
 * configurable and short by default for exactly that reason — the price of qits-events being down
 * is a few seconds per green build, paid once, after which the outbox owns the problem.
