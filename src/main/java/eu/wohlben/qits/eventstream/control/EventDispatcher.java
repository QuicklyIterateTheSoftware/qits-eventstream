/**
 * The registry of listener beans — {@link QitsEventListener}, {@link QitsRawEventListener} and
 * {@link QitsDurableEventListener} — and the routing of one arriving frame to them.
 *
 * <p>Two jobs that are really one: the set of signatures to subscribe to and what dispatch will
 * route are the <em>same</em> derivation from the same beans, so a listener cannot be subscribed for
 * and then not delivered to, or vice versa. That symmetry is the reason this is not two classes, and
 * it survives the raw seam: {@link #signatures()} and {@link #dispatch} both read {@link
 * QitsRawEventListener#signatures()} live rather than caching an answer one of them could then
 * disagree with.
 *
 * <p><b>Not CDI events.</b> Delivery is a direct call on the listener bean. Routing remote arrivals
 * through {@code @Observes} would make them indistinguishable from locally fired events of the same
 * type at every observer site — the plan's {@code @FromEventBus} qualifier exists to fix that if
 * CDI delivery were ever wanted, and it is not needed while the interface is the contract.
 *
 * <p><b>The beans are resolved once, at first use; the raw listeners' signature sets are not.</b>
 * Which bean exists is a build-time fact. What a raw listener wants is deliberately a runtime one —
 * that is the seam's whole purpose — so it is asked per subscribe and per frame. The consequence
 * worth stating: a widened raw set takes effect for dispatch immediately and reaches the wire only
 * at the next reconnect, which is why {@link QitsRawEventListener}'s javadoc tells a consumer with a
 * growing interest to say {@code "*"} once and filter for itself.
 *
 * <h2>The subscription union, and what {@code "*"} does to it</h2>
 *
 * <p>The frame sent to qits-events is the union of every typed listener's signature and every raw
 * listener's set, sorted. {@link QitsRawEventListener#ALL} anywhere in that union <b>collapses it to
 * {@code ["*"]}</b>: once one consumer wants everything, narrowing the wire buys nothing, and the
 * extra frames are dropped here at no cost to anyone else.
 *
 * <h2>Dispatch order: typed, raw, durable</h2>
 *
 * <p>Stated because it is a contract rather than an accident. Typed dispatch is the path that
 * already existed and its consumers are the domain handlers for a specific event; the raw seam is
 * open-ended, cross-cutting and, in its motivating case, does real work per frame. Putting it second
 * is what makes "typed dispatch is unchanged" true in the only way that is observable from a typed
 * listener — when it is called relative to the frame's arrival. Both paths run for a frame both want,
 * each listener gets it once, and a throw anywhere in either is contained, so neither path can
 * shorten the other.
 *
 * <p><b>Durable listeners are last, and they are the only path that touches a database.</b> Their
 * arrival goes through {@link DurableFunnel} rather than straight to the bean — one transaction that
 * claims the event and calls the handler — so a live frame and a caught-up row are the same code
 * path and the effect is exactly-once per (listener, event). This class stays the only place that
 * knows which beans exist: {@link CatchupSweeper} reads the durable ones from here rather than
 * collecting its own, because two registries that disagree would mean a listener subscribed for live
 * and never caught up, or the reverse.
