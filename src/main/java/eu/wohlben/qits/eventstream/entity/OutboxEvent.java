/**
 * An event that did not reach qits-events on the first try. The envelope, kept whole, plus what the
 * sweeper needs to decide when to try again and when to stop.
 *
 * <p><b>Failure-path-only persistence.</b> A publish that succeeds inline writes nothing at all —
 * this table exists for the unhappy case and is empty in a healthy process. That is the specified
 * design and it has one named hole: a crash between the inline attempt failing and this row
 * committing loses the event. Closing it is the write-ahead variant (persist first, delete on ack),
 * which is a one-method change inside {@code Outbox} and is deliberately not made.
 *
 * <p>{@link #id} is the event's own UUID, not a row key of our own. That is what makes a retry safe
 * rather than merely permitted: qits-events keys on it, so a {@code PUT} whose response was lost
 * replays as a 200 instead of writing the event twice.
