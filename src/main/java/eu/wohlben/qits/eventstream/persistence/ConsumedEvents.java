/**
 * The claim ledger: which events one durable listener has already handled.
 *
 * <p><b>No entity, and that is deliberate.</b> Nothing here loads an object — the table is written
 * with one conditional insert, read with one existence question and emptied in bulk — so an entity
 * would exist only to give Hibernate a name for a table these three statements already name. It
 * would need an {@code @IdClass} to do it, too, since the key is the pair.
 *
 * <p><b>The claim is {@code on conflict do nothing}, which is the whole concurrency design.</b> Two
 * channels race for the same event by construction: a live frame on the socket's worker thread and a
 * catch-up row on the scheduler's. The second inserter blocks on the first one's uncommitted row and
 * then finds it — or, if the first rolled back, wins the claim itself. A read-then-insert would have
 * a window where both read "not handled"; the primary key has none.
