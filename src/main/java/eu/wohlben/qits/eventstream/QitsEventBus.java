/**
 * Publish an event. The whole producing API: one method and one overload of it, no channel, no
 * topic, no configuration at the call site.
 *
 * <p><b>Fire-and-forget for the caller, durable for the event.</b> {@link #publish} attempts the
 * idempotent {@code PUT} inline and returns; if that does not land, the event goes to the outbox
 * and a scheduled sweeper owns it from there. So a caller never sees a delivery failure and never
 * has to decide what to do about one — which is what lets the publish hook sit in the middle of a
 * business transition without becoming a way for that transition to fail.
 *
 * <p>It does not throw. The two things that could — an event class Jackson cannot serialize, and a
 * database that will not take the outbox row — are logged and dropped, because an event is an
 * announcement and losing one must never be worse for the caller than the thing it was announcing.
 * An unserializable event is a programming error that shows up as a warning on the first publish,
 * which is the right amount of noise for something no retry would fix.
 *
 * <p><b>And it writes no row for either, which was weighed rather than overlooked.</b> The
 * unserializable case stopped being hypothetical the day a native image could not reflect on the
 * event class, and "at least record the loss" was the obvious repair. It does not fit: the
 * serializer is what threw, so there is no {@code payload} — the one thing an outbox row exists to
 * hold — and a {@code FAILED} row with a null payload is one the sweeper can never retry and a
 * dead-letter view could never resend. In the second case, writing a row is the identical database
 * write that just failed. The outbox is what has <em>not arrived yet</em>, which is what lets its
 * row count be a health signal rather than a log; the record of an event that could not be built is
 * the warning below, carrying the id and the signature, and that warning is how the native-image gap
 * was actually found.
 *
 * <p>Disabled ({@code qits.eventstream.enabled=false}) it is a debug log and nothing else: no
 * request, no row, no subscriber. That is the {@code %dev}/{@code %test} posture the platform gives
 * every external telemetry-shaped dependency, and it means a test suite that never configured
 * qits-events makes no dials rather than five retries' worth.
 *
 * <p><b>Causation is stamped here, and nowhere else.</b> The envelope's {@code parentId} is resolved
 * at the one point an envelope is built — {@link #publish(QitsEvent, UUID)} — from an explicit
 * argument if there is one and from {@link CausationScope} otherwise. Deliberately <em>not</em> a
 * fifth {@link QitsEvent} method: an event record is immutable and its parent is known later than
 * it is, a default method reading a thread-local would answer differently on the sweeper's thread
 * an hour later (which is precisely what {@code eventId}'s stability argument forbids), and a fifth
 * accessor would need a fifth {@code @JsonIgnore} in the one place this repo has already been bitten
 * silently. Identity travels in the envelope; so does causation.
 *
 * <p><b>And so does the environment.</b> The tier this process runs in is {@code qits.environment} —
 * the MicroProfile spelling of the {@code QITS_ENVIRONMENT} the deployer injects into every
 * environment-tier service — and where a deployment injects none the process is, by the platform's
 * own definition, serving every tier: the fallback is the literal {@code "platform"}. Resolved once
 * per publish, at the same single point the cause is, so the outbox row stores it and a sweep after
 * a reconfiguration resends what the inline attempt sent. The property name is spelled literally
 * here rather than imported from qits-integrations-quarkus' {@code EnvironmentHeader}: the
 * extraction rule admits no foreign {@code eu.wohlben.qits.*} import, so the string is the shared
 * contract — grep both repos on a rename.

   * runtime does not — typically that the causation crossed a thread and a database row on its way
   * here, which no thread-local could have carried.

   * The detach is a statement about a region; the price of saying it there is that {@code publish}
   * keeps a single shape.
   *
   * <p><b>No self-parent repair and no cycle guard.</b> A guard that catches only {@code A → A}
   * cannot see {@code A → B → A}, and its presence would tell a reader that cycles are handled.
   * Detection belongs where the graph is visible; qits-events does reject a self-edge, because that
   * one is decidable from a single row.
